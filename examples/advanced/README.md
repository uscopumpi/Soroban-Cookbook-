# Advanced Examples

This category contains examples of complex systems and advanced architectural patterns for experienced Soroban developers. These examples tackle sophisticated problems and often involve multi-contract interactions and intricate state management.

## What's Inside?

- **Complex Authorization**: Patterns like threshold signatures and multi-party authorization for high-security applications.
- **State Machines**: Contracts that implement complex, multi-step workflows like time-delayed execution.
- **Upgrade Governance**: Admin controls, timelocks, and emergency pauses around contract upgrades.
- **Bridge Defenses**: Inbound bridge release controls such as rate limiting, challenge windows, fraud proofs, and emergency pause.
- **Gas & Ledger Optimization**: Techniques for building highly efficient and scalable contracts.
- **Oracle Patterns**: Single-source oracle with authorized submission and freshness validation.

## Implemented Examples

- [`01-multi-party-auth`](./01-multi-party-auth/) — Multi-party authorization patterns
- [`02-timelock`](./02-timelock/) — Time-delayed execution
- [`03-permit-pattern`](./03-permit-pattern/) — EIP-2612-style permit approvals with deadline enforcement
- [`03-gasless-relayer`](./03-gasless-relayer/) — Meta-transaction relayer with nonce checks and signature verification
- [`03-data-aggregation-oracle`](./03-data-aggregation-oracle/) — Data aggregation with manipulation detection and outlier filtering (Phase 5)
- [`03-oracle-pattern`](./03-oracle-pattern/) — Basic oracle with freshness checks
- [`04-circuit-breaker`](./04-circuit-breaker/) — Emergency pause and auto-recovery pattern
- [`05-bridge-security`](./05-bridge-security/) — Rate limiting, pause, challenge window, and fraud-proof patterns for bridge releases
- [`05-rate-limiting`](./05-rate-limiting/) — Per-user time- and amount-based rate limiting with admin overrides
- [`06-beacon-management`](./06-beacon-management/) — Versioned beacon management with rollback support
- [`07-upgrade-patterns`](./07-upgrade-patterns/) — Direct WASM upgrade, versioned storage migration, init guards
- [`09-fuzz-testing`](./09-fuzz-testing/) — Fuzzable claimable-balance contract with property tests and cargo-fuzz targets
- [`10-contract-migrations`](./10-contract-migrations/) — Batched v1→v2 storage migration with dual-read and version gates

## Planned Examples

- [`04-bridge-validators`](./04-bridge-validators/) — Bridge validators and multi-sig threshold
- `05-atomic-swaps`: A trustless, cross-contract asset swap.
- `05-payment-channels`: A basic state channel implementation for off-chain transactions.
- `08-batch-operations`: Batch call interface with atomic rollback and partial execution modes.
