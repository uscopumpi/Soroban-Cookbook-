# Vesting Management

This example demonstrates how to implement a secure, production-grade token vesting contract with revocation capabilities, cliff-duration enforcement, and isolated multi-beneficiary support in Soroban.

## Key Concepts

- **Linear Vesting**: Continuous and linear release of tokens over a specified duration after a cliff period.
- **Cliff Period**: A mandatory waiting period during which no tokens are vested or claimable.
- **Revocation**: Admin capability to cancel a schedule mid-vesting, returning unvested tokens to the admin while keeping vested-but-unclaimed tokens claimable by the beneficiary.
- **Multi-Beneficiary Isolation**: Supports managing independent schedules for different beneficiaries, each with their own allocation parameters and token addresses.
- **Arithmetic Safety**: Uses safe, checked arithmetic (`checked_mul`, `checked_add`, `checked_sub`, `checked_div`) to guarantee zero underflow/overflow risk.

## Storage Model

The contract uses Soroban's persistent storage to track independent vesting schedules for each beneficiary, and instance storage for global config parameters:

- `Admin`: The privileged admin address allowed to create and revoke schedules (Instance storage).
- `DefaultToken`: An optional default SEP-41 token used if no specific token is provided for a schedule (Instance storage).
- `Schedule(beneficiary)`: The `VestingSchedule` struct for a specific beneficiary (Persistent storage).

## Vesting Schedule Schema

```rust
#[contracttype]
#[derive(Clone, Debug, Eq, PartialEq)]
pub struct VestingSchedule {
    pub beneficiary: Address,     // Beneficiary address
    pub total_amount: i128,       // Total tokens allocated
    pub released_amount: i128,    // Total tokens already claimed
    pub start_timestamp: u64,     // Starting timestamp of the schedule
    pub cliff_duration: u64,      // Duration in seconds before any tokens vest
    pub vesting_duration: u64,    // Total duration in seconds over which tokens vest
    pub revoked: bool,            // Whether this schedule has been revoked
    pub token: Address,           // Address of the vested SEP-41 token
}
```

## Linear Vesting Calculation

At any block timestamp $T$:
1. If $T < \text{start\_timestamp} + \text{cliff\_duration}$:
   - Vested amount is $0$.
2. If $T \geq \text{start\_timestamp} + \text{vesting\_duration}$:
   - Vested amount is the total allocated $\text{total\_amount}$.
3. Otherwise (mid-vesting):
   - $\text{elapsed\_time} = T - \text{start\_timestamp}$
   - $\text{vested\_amount} = \frac{\text{total\_amount} \times \text{elapsed\_time}}{\text{vesting\_duration}}$

---

## Design Decision: Revocation Flow

When an admin revokes a vesting schedule:
1. The contract calculates the vested amount up to the current timestamp $T_{\text{revoke}}$ using linear interpolation.
2. The `total_amount` is capped exactly at the calculated vested amount ($T_{\text{revoke}}$), and the schedule is marked as `revoked = true`.
3. Any unvested remainder ($\text{total\_amount} - \text{vested\_amount}$) is transferred back to the admin immediately.
4. Beneficiaries retain full rights to any vested-but-unclaimed tokens. They can claim them at any time in the future.
5. No further vesting accrues after revocation.

## Contract Interface

### `initialize`
Initializes the contract with an admin and an optional default token.
```rust
pub fn initialize(env: Env, admin: Address, default_token: Option<Address>) -> Result<(), VestingError>;
```

### `create_schedule`
Creates a vesting schedule for a beneficiary. Only callable by the admin.
```rust
pub fn create_schedule(
    env: Env,
    admin: Address,
    beneficiary: Address,
    total_amount: i128,
    start_timestamp: u64,
    cliff_duration: u64,
    vesting_duration: u64,
    token: Option<Address>,
) -> Result<(), VestingError>;
```

### `claim`
Transfers all currently vested-but-unclaimed tokens to the beneficiary. Requires beneficiary's authorization.
```rust
pub fn claim(env: Env, beneficiary: Address) -> Result<i128, VestingError>;
```

### `revoke`
Revokes an active vesting schedule. Only callable by the admin.
```rust
pub fn revoke(env: Env, admin: Address, beneficiary: Address) -> Result<(), VestingError>;
```

### `vested_amount`
Read-only query to get the total number of tokens vested up to the current ledger timestamp.
```rust
pub fn vested_amount(env: Env, beneficiary: Address) -> Result<i128, VestingError>;
```

### `releasable_amount`
Read-only query to get the remaining claimable amount ($\text{vested\_amount} - \text{released\_amount}$).
```rust
pub fn releasable_amount(env: Env, beneficiary: Address) -> Result<i128, VestingError>;
```

### `transfer_admin`
Allows the current admin to transfer administrative capabilities to a new address.
```rust
pub fn transfer_admin(env: Env, admin: Address, new_admin: Address) -> Result<(), VestingError>;
```
