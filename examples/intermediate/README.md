# Intermediate Examples

This category contains examples that demonstrate common, real-world design patterns and use cases for Soroban smart contracts. These examples combine multiple basic concepts to solve practical problems and prepare you for production-grade contract development.

## 🎯 What's Inside?

- **Access Control**: Implement patterns like multi-sig, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and timelocks.
- **Cross-Contract Communication**: See how to build systems with factory, proxy, and registry patterns.
- **Token Interactions**: Learn how to create contracts that interact with or wrap standard tokens.
- **Advanced Data Structures**: Examples of iterable maps, queues, and other complex data structures.
- **Emergency Controls**: Pause/unpause pattern for halting sensitive operations.

## Implemented Examples

- [`multi-sig-patterns`](./multi-sig-patterns/) — Threshold signatures and multi-party auth
- [`ajo-factory`](./ajo-factory/) — Contract deployment from within a contract
- [`03-pause-unpause`](./03-pause-unpause/) — Emergency pause/unpause mechanism
- [`storage-migration`](./storage-migration/) — Versioned storage upgrades with explicit staging and batch execution.
- [`event-history`](./event-history/) — On-chain audit history storage with cursor-based pagination, filtering, and capacity management.
- [`lazy-loading`](./lazy-loading/) — Lazy loading and bounded caching to reduce gas on large storage sets.
- [`storage-pagination`](./storage-pagination/) — Per-item storage with opaque cursor-based `list(page_size, cursor)` pagination.
- [`event-aggregation`](./event-aggregation/) — Batch multiple actions into a single emitted event to reduce per-event overhead.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before diving into intermediate examples, make sure you've completed:
- [Basic Examples](../basics/) — Core Soroban concepts (storage, auth, errors, events)
- [Getting Started Guide](../../book/src/guides/getting-started.md) — Development environment setup
- [Testing Guide](../../book/src/guides/testing.md) — Unit and integration testing patterns

## 🚀 Building & Testing

```bash
# Build the contract
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Run tests
cargo test
```
