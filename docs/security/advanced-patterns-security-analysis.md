## 1. Multi-Party Authorization

**Contract:** `examples/advanced/01-multi-party-auth/`

### Known Vulnerabilities
| Vulnerability | Severity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unbounded signer iteration | Medium | Large signer lists may exceed gas limits, bricking the contract. |
| Replay of approval sets | Medium | Same approval set reused across proposals without nonce tracking. |
| Duplicate signer abuse | Low | Duplicate signers inflate threshold without adding security. |

### Mitigation Strategies
- Enforce `MAX_SIGNERS` (e.g., 20) in production contracts.
- Mark proposals as consumed after execution to prevent replay.
- Deduplicate signer lists during encoding.

### Security Properties Guaranteed
- Authorization enforced at the host level via `require_auth()`.
- Canonical encoding ensures deterministic storage keys.
- Event emission provides audit trail.

---

## 2. Timelock Execution

**Contract:** `examples/advanced/02-timelock/`

### Known Vulnerabilities
| Vulnerability | Severity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Admin delay bypass | Critical | Admin sets delay to zero, executing arbitrary operations immediately. |
| Reentrant execute | High | `execute()` makes external calls that could reenter before state finalization. |
| Front-running | Medium | Attacker sees queued operation and front-runs with malicious params. |

### Mitigation Strategies
- Enforce minimum delay bounds that require multi-sig to change.
- Apply reentrancy guard on `execute()`.
- Commit-reveal or hash-commit for operation parameters.

### Security Properties Guaranteed
- Operations cannot execute before `min_delay` elapses.
- Only admin can queue/cancel.
- Pause stops execution without clearing queue.

---

## 3. Oracle Patterns

**Contracts:** `examples/advanced/03-oracle-pattern/`, `examples/advanced/03-data-aggregation-oracle/`

### Known Vulnerabilities
| Vulnerability | Severity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stale price acceptance | High | Consumer uses price without checking timestamp. |
| Single submitter manipulation | High | One compromised submitter controls the feed. |
| Outlier filter bypass | Medium | Attacker floods with similar manipulated values. |
| Timestamp manipulation | Low | Submitter reports false timestamp. |

### Mitigation Strategies
- Consumers must always verify `last_updated + freshness_threshold > current_time`.
- Use multi-source aggregation with M-of-N submitters.
- Apply deviation checks: reject values >X% from median.
- Accept only host-provided `env.ledger().timestamp()`.

### Security Properties Guaranteed
- Freshness validation built into the oracle contract.
- Authorized submitter list controls write access.
- Aggregation oracle uses median for manipulation resistance.

---

## 4. Cross-Chain Bridge

**Contract:** `examples/advanced/03-cross-chain-bridge/`

### Known Vulnerabilities
| Vulnerability | Severity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Validator collusion | Critical | M-of-N validators collude to release unbacked assets. |
| Replay attacks | High | Same message processed twice across chains. |
| Light client spoofing | High | Fake headers accepted due to insufficient verification. |
| Pause bypass | Medium | Admin pauses but emergency path lacks auth. |

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use economic slashing for misbehavior.
- Nonce and source-chain-id in every message.
- Timelock + multi-sig for admin operations.
- Challenge window with fraud proofs.

### Security Properties Guaranteed
- M-of-N threshold prevents single-validator compromise.
- Nonce-based replay protection.
- Pausable with timelock delay.

---

## 5. Bridge Security

**Contract:** `examples/advanced/05-bridge-security/`

### Known Vulnerabilities
| Vulnerability | Severity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rate limit reset | Medium | Attacker resets epoch counter to bypass caps. |
| Challenge griefing | Medium | Validators spam challenges to delay legitimate releases. |
| Fraud proof timeout | High | Window too short for honest validators to respond. |

### Mitigation Strategies
- Epoch based on `ledger.timestamp()`, not storage counters.
- Bond requirement for challenges to prevent spam.
- Configurable window with governance override.

### Security Properties Guaranteed
- Per-epoch volume caps enforced.
- Challenge window allows disputes before finalization.
- Fraud proofs trigger slashing.

| Storage collision | High | Implementation storage layout incompatible with proxy. |
| Uninitialized implementation | High | Implementation contract called directly without init. |
| Admin private key compromise | Critical | Single key controls all upgrades. |

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use unique admin function selectors (e.g., `upgrade(address)`).
- Adhere to EIP-1967 storage slot convention.
- Make implementation constructor self-destruct or revert.
- Require multi-sig or timelock for upgrades.

### Security Properties Guaranteed
- Implementation address stored in protected slot.
- Only admin can upgrade.
- Direct calls to implementation revert.

---

## 7. Diamond Pattern

**Contracts:** `examples/advanced/05-diamond-facets/`, `examples/advanced/05-diamond-security/`, `examples/advanced/06-diamond-pattern/`

### Known Vulnerabilities
| Vulnerability | Severity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Selector collision across facets | Critical | Two facets define the same function selector. |
| Storage collision across facets | Critical | Facets use overlapping storage slots. |
| Immutable function shadowing | High | `diamondCut` overwritten by facet. |
| Facet removal bricking | Medium | Removing a facet breaks existing functionality. |

### Mitigation Strategies
- Enforce unique selectors during `diamondCut`.
- Use Diamond Storage pattern (app-specific storage structs at random slots).
- Immutable functions stored in diamond itself, not facets.
- Require multi-sig for facet removal.

### Security Properties Guaranteed
- Dispatch based on selector-facet mapping.
- `diamondCut` authority restricted to admin.
- Loupe functions provide introspection.

### Known Vulnerabilities
| Vulnerability | Severity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Beacon update bricking all proxies | Critical | Updating beacon to broken implementation breaks all proxies. |
| Rollback to vulnerable version | High | Admin rolls back to a known-vulnerable implementation. |
| Beacon initialization front-run | Medium | Attacker initializes beacon before legitimate deployer. |

### Mitigation Strategies
- Staged rollout: update beacon, monitor, then confirm.
- Version blacklist: prevent rollback to known-vulnerable versions.
- Constructor-style initialization in deploy transaction.

### Security Properties Guaranteed
- All proxies read from single beacon source.
- Version history tracked for audit.
- Rollback only to previously-deployed versions.

---

## 9. Role-Based Access Control

**Contracts:** `examples/advanced/03-rbac-modifiers/`, `examples/advanced/03-registry-access-controls/`, `examples/advanced/03-proxy-admin/`

| Role escalation | Critical | User granted role can self-elevate to admin. |
| Renounce with no backup | Medium | Last admin renounces, permanently locking contract. |
| Role hash collision | Low | Two role names produce same hash. |

### Mitigation Strategies
- Enforce separation: role admin != role holder for admin roles.
- Require at least N admins before allowing renounce.
- Use long unique role identifiers.

### Security Properties Guaranteed
- `require_auth()` checked for every restricted function.
- Role management emits events.
- Default admin cannot renounce if sole admin.

### Known Vulnerabilities
| Vulnerability | Severity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cyclic hierarchy | High | Node becomes its own ancestor, causing infinite loop. |
| Permission escalation via parent | Medium | Parent node grants self child permissions they should not have. |
| Orphaned subtree | Medium | Removing mid-level node disconnects children. |

### Mitigation Strategies

| Cross-function reentrancy | High | One guarded function calls another guarded function in same contract. |
| Gas exhaustion via lock | Low | Lock not released if function panics after setting. |
| View function bypass | Low | Reentrancy via view function that calls state-changing external. |

### Mitigation Strategies
