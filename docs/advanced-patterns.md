## 1. Multi-Party Authorization

**Location:** `examples/advanced/01-multi-party-auth/`

### What it does
Requires multiple parties to authorize an action before it executes. Supports M-of-N threshold signatures, compact authorization vectors, and sequential approvals.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Authorization vectors** encode signer lists into sorted, deduplicated `Bytes` blobs instead of `Vec<Address>`, reducing storage costs.
- **Canonical sorting** ensures determinism: any input order produces the same blob, enabling use as a storage key.
- **Audit trail events** emit structured payloads for off-chain indexers.

### Trade-offs
| Approach | Storage Cost | Flexibility | Gas Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| N-of-N (direct) | None | Low | O(N) auth |
| M-of-N (proposal) | Proposal state | High | O(M+N) storage |
| Auth vectors | Compact Bytes | Medium | O(N log N) encode |

### When to use
- **N-of-N**: Atomic joint agreements, pair-based approvals, high-value transfers requiring unanimity.
- **M-of-N**: DAO governance, corporate treasury, security-critical upgrades.
- **Auth vectors**: Storing signer lists on-chain, cross-contract signer passing.

---

## 2. Timelock Execution

**Location:** `examples/advanced/02-timelock/`

### What it does
Delays action execution by a configurable time window. Users queue operations with a minimum delay, then execute after the delay elapses. Supports cancellation and delay bounds.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Delay bounds** prevent admin from setting delay to zero (bypass) or unreasonably long (lock funds).
- **Pausable** execution allows emergency stop without altering queued operations.
- **Flat storage model** uses a `DataKey` enum instead of hashed keys for clarity.

### Trade-offs
| Feature | Benefit | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Delay bounds | Safety guarantee | Storage for two values |
| Pause | Emergency control | Centralization risk |
| Queue state tracking | Visibility | Per-operation storage |

### When to use
- Contract upgrades with user opt-out window
- Treasury withdrawals requiring notice period
- Any operation where users need time to react

---

## 3. Oracle Patterns

**Location:** `examples/advanced/03-oracle-pattern/`, `examples/advanced/03-data-aggregation-oracle/`

### Basic Oracle
Single-source oracle with authorized submission and freshness validation. A designated submitter pushes data, and consumers check a timestamp to reject stale values.

### Data Aggregation Oracle
Multi-source oracle that aggregates data from multiple submitters using median, mean, or mode. Includes outlier detection and manipulation resistance.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Freshness threshold** configures how old a value may be before rejection.
- **Submitter whitelist** restricts who can write data.
- **Outlier filtering** drops values more than N standard deviations from the mean.

### When to use
- **Basic oracle**: Single trusted price feed, simple data availability.
- **Aggregation oracle**: DeFi protocols needing manipulation-resistant prices, multi-source feeds.

---

## 4. Cross-Chain Bridge

**Location:** `examples/advanced/03-cross-chain-bridge/`

### What it does
Lock-and-mint bridge pattern where assets are locked on the source chain and minted as wrapped representations on Soroban. Supports validator threshold verification.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Validator set** stored on-chain with M-of-N threshold for release.
- **Nonce-based replay protection** prevents double-processing.
- **Pausable** for emergency scenarios.

### When to use
- Cross-chain asset transfers between Stellar and other ecosystems.
- Wrapped asset creation with decentralized validation.

---

## 5. Bridge Security

**Location:** `examples/advanced/05-bridge-security/`

### What it does
Implements security guards for bridge operations: rate limiting, pause mechanisms, challenge windows, and fraud proofs.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Rate limiting** tracks per-epoch volume and rejects spikes.
- **Challenge window** allows validators to contest a release before finalization.
- **Fraud proofs** enable slashing of malicious validators.

### When to use
Any bridge or cross-chain application requiring:
- Volume caps per time window
- Decentralized dispute resolution
- Economic security via slashing

---

## 6. Upgradeable Proxies

**Location:** `examples/advanced/04-upgradeable-proxy/`

### What it does
Proxy pattern that delegates calls to an implementation contract. Admin can swap the implementation address to upgrade contract logic without changing the contract ID.

### Architecture Decisions
- **EIP-1967-style storage slot** for implementation address to avoid collision with implementation storage.
- **Admin-controlled** upgrade with timelock integration option.

### When to use
- Contracts needing post-deployment logic updates.
- Projects following an iterative development cycle.
- Protocol-owned contracts requiring governance upgrades.

---

## 7. Diamond Pattern

**Location:** `examples/advanced/05-diamond-facets/`, `examples/advanced/05-diamond-security/`, `examples/advanced/06-diamond-pattern/`

### What it does
Splits contract logic across multiple facet contracts, each responsible for a subset of functions. A diamond proxy routes calls to the appropriate facet.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Facet-selector mapping** stored in the diamond for O(1) dispatch.
- **Immutable functions** (e.g., `receive`) can be inlined to save gas.
- **Upgrade path** allows adding/replacing facets without touching others.

### Trade-offs
| Approach | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Monolithic | Simple, one contract | No upgrade granularity |
| Proxy + 1 impl | Standard upgrade | Single upgrade scope |
| Diamond | Granular upgrades | Dispatch overhead, complexity |

### When to use
- Large contracts exceeding WASM size limits.
- Systems requiring per-function upgrade authority.
- Complex protocols with separable modules.

---

## 8. Beacon Proxy

**Location:** `examples/advanced/02-beacon-proxy/`, `examples/advanced/06-beacon-management/`

### What it does
Beacon pattern where multiple proxy contracts point to a single beacon contract that stores the implementation address. Updating the beacon upgrades all proxies atomically.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Beacon registry** maps implementation versions to deployment timestamps.
- **Rollback support** allows reverting to a previous version.
- **Versioned upgrades** track all implementation changes.

### When to use
- Many proxy instances needing simultaneous upgrade.
- Standardized contract factories (e.g., token factories).
- Systems requiring upgrade audit trail.

---

## 9. Role-Based Access Control

**Location:** `examples/advanced/03-rbac-modifiers/`, `examples/advanced/03-registry-access-controls/`, `examples/advanced/03-proxy-admin/`

### What it does
Assigns roles to addresses and restricts function access by role. Supports role hierarchies, admin delegation, and role revocation.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Role as `BytesN<32>` hash** prevents role name collisions.
- **Default admin role** can manage other roles.
- **Role renouncement** allows addresses to self-remove.

### When to use
- Multi-user systems with distinct permission levels.
- Admin + operator + user separation.
- Delegated authority patterns.

---

## 10. Hierarchical Access Control

**Location:** `examples/advanced/05-hierarchical-access-control/`

### What it does
Extends RBAC with hierarchical organization units. Permissions propagate down the hierarchy: department heads inherit team-level access.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Tree-based storage** maps each node to its parent and children.
- **Inheritance resolution** walks the tree upward to check transitive permissions.
- **Separation of duties** enforced at each hierarchy level.

### When to use
- Organizational structures (companies, DAOs with departments).
- Multi-tenant systems.
- Fine-grained permission escalation paths.

---

## 11. Batch Operations

**Location:** `examples/advanced/08-batch-operations/`

### What it does
Executes multiple contract calls in a single transaction with configurable atomicity. Supports all-succeed-or-fail and partial-execution modes.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Atomic mode**: any failure reverts all prior operations.
- **Partial mode**: failures are recorded but successful operations persist.
- **Operation queue** stored as `Vec<Call>` for predictable iteration.

### When to use
- Bulk token transfers.
- Multi-step setup transactions.
- Gas optimization through call consolidation.

---

## 12. Merkle Proofs

**Location:** `examples/advanced/05-merkle-proofs/`

### What it does
Validates data membership in a Merkle tree using on-chain proof verification. Enables off-chain data storage with on-chain verification.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Keccak-256 hashing** for compatibility with off-chain proof generation.
- **Sorted leaf nodes** to prevent second-preimage attacks.
- **Configurable tree depth** to bound gas costs.

### When to use
- Airdrop eligibility verification.
- Off-chain storage of large datasets.
- Cross-chain state verification.

---

## 13. Reentrancy Guard

**Location:** `examples/advanced/05-reentrancy-guard/`

### What it does
Prevents reentrant calls by tracking execution state. Uses a mutex flag that blocks nested invocations.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Storage-based flag** persists across the call lifecycle.
- **Modifier pattern** wraps functions with `lock/unlock`.
- **No reentrancy** for external-facing state-changing functions.

### When to use
- Contracts accepting external calls during execution.
- Cross-contract transfer or callback patterns.
- Any contract holding user funds.
